Hi, this is the final project for 21-366 S 2025. 
Author: Jiasi Wang, Jimmy Wu
This project implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for solving the Black-Scholes PDE and fitting real-world options pricing data. It blends traditional mathematical modeling with modern deep learning to improve financial prediction accuracy.

Data: Since the data set is too large, we will send it to you through email!
Run the file: python Stage2.py
